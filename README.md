# Predicting-The-Quality-of-a-wine
The Wine Quality Prediction project is designed to harness the power of data science and machine learning to evaluate and predict the quality of wines. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of wine characteristics such as acidity levels, alcohol content, residual sugar, and more, our predictive model assesses the overall quality rating of a given wine sample.
